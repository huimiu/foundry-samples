# What this sample demonstrates

This sample demonstrates a **key advantage of code-based hosted agents**:

- **Agents in Workflows** - Use AI agents as executors within a workflow pipeline

Code-based agents can execute **any Python code** you write. This sample includes a multi-agent workflow where Writer and Reviewer agents collaborate to draft content and provide review feedback.

The agent is hosted using the [Azure AI AgentServer SDK](https://pypi.org/project/azure-ai-agentserver-agentframework/) and can be deployed to Microsoft Foundry using the Azure Developer CLI.

## How It Works

### Agents in Workflows

This sample demonstrates the integration of AI agents within a workflow pipeline. The workflow operates as follows:

1. **Writer Agent** - Drafts content
2. **Reviewer Agent** - Reviews the draft and provides concise, actionable feedback

### Agent Hosting

The agent workflow is hosted using the [Azure AI AgentServer SDK](https://pypi.org/project/azure-ai-agentserver-agentframework/),
which provisions a REST API endpoint compatible with the OpenAI Responses protocol.

### Agent Deployment

The hosted agent workflow can be deployed to Microsoft Foundry using the Azure Developer CLI [ai agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/concepts/hosted-agents?view=foundry&tabs=cli#create-a-hosted-agent) extension.

## Running the Agent Locally

### Prerequisites

Before running this sample, ensure you have:

1. **Azure AI Foundry Project**
   - Project created in [Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/what-is-foundry?view=foundry#microsoft-foundry-portals)
   - Chat model deployed (e.g., `gpt-4o` or `gpt-4.1`)
   - Note your project endpoint URL and model deployment name

2. **Azure CLI**
   - Installed and authenticated
   - Run `az login` and verify with `az account show`

3. **Python 3.10 or higher**
   - Verify your version: `python --version`
   - If you have Python 3.9 or older, install a newer version:
     - Windows: `winget install Python.Python.3.12`
     - macOS: `brew install python@3.12`
     - Linux: Use your package manager

### Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables (matching `agent.yaml`):

- `PROJECT_ENDPOINT` - Your Azure AI Foundry project endpoint URL (required)
- `MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` - The deployment name for your chat model (defaults to `gpt-4.1-mini`)

This sample loads environment variables from a local `.env` file if present.

Create a `.env` file in this directory with the following content:

```
PROJECT_ENDPOINT=https://<your-resource>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<your-project>
MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-4.1-mini
```

Or set them via PowerShell:

```powershell
# Replace with your actual values
$env:PROJECT_ENDPOINT="https://<your-resource>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<your-project>"
$env:MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="gpt-4.1-mini"
```

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies:

**macOS/Linux:**

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### Installing Dependencies

Install the required Python dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Sample

To run the agent, execute the following command in your terminal:

```powershell
python main.py
```

This will start the hosted agent locally on `http://localhost:8088/`.

### Interacting with the Agent

**PowerShell (Windows):**

```powershell
$body = @{
   input = "Create a slogan for a new electric SUV that is affordable and fun to drive."
    stream = $false
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:8088/responses -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```

**Bash/curl (Linux/macOS):**

```bash
curl -sS -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8088/responses \
   -d '{"input": "Create a slogan for a new electric SUV that is affordable and fun to drive.","stream":false}'
```

### Deploying the Agent to Microsoft Foundry

To deploy your agent to Microsoft Foundry, follow the comprehensive deployment guide at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/concepts/hosted-agents?view=foundry&tabs=cli

## Troubleshooting

### Images built on Apple Silicon or other ARM64 machines do not work on our service

We **recommend using `azd` cloud build**, which always builds images with the correct architecture.

If you choose to **build locally**, and your machine is **not `linux/amd64`** (for example, an Apple Silicon Mac), the image will **not be compatible with our service**, causing runtime failures.

**Fix for local builds**

Use this command to build the image locally:

```shell
docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -t image .
```

This forces the image to be built for the required `amd64` architecture.
